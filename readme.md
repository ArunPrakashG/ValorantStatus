# ValorantStatus
### Best RPC client for Valorant
ValorantStatus is the best RPC client for Valorant. Great for performance, and full party features make this the best client to use. Party features are avalable for open parties only.
# [Download the installer](https://github.com/brianbaldner/ValorantStatus/releases/latest/download/ValorantStatusInstall.exe)
After installing, you can replace your Valorant shortcut with the ValorantStatus shortcut to launch Valorant with RPC. When ValorantStatus is launched, it automatically launches Valorant.

If you have any feature requests, message bigtaco#4277 on Discord.

# Uninstalling

The installer does not include an uninstaller, so to uninstall, run the line below in a command prompt with admin priveliges to remove the folder.

`rmdir /s "C:\Program Files (x86)\ValorantStatus"`

# Contribution

Please fork and add whatever you want. Please pull request though, instead of distributing yourself. All of the code is in /ValorantStatus/MainWindow.xaml.cs and I added tons of comments to help.
